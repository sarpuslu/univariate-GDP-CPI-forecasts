# Multi-step Quarterly CPI & GDP forecasts by ARIMA & Dynamic Linear Models
## Introduction
Inflation (CPI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are two important economic data points describing the well being of an economy. According to Ray Dalio we can classify economies roughly in 4 classes (high growth high inflation, high growth low inflation, low growth high inflation, low growth low inflation) and invest in different asset classes based on this classification. 

## Motivation
This project is an attempt to forecast multi-step ahead CPI and GDP using ARIMA and Dynamic Linear Models to identify the direction of major economies. 

## Approach
Just like any other univariate time series forecasting method the goal here is to build models to find best function that describes the relation between past and future values. Highest growth economies are identified and forecasting errors of these models are compared and discussed.
